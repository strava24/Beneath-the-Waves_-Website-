Iâ€™m thrilled to present a website I developed as part of my university coursework, focused on the 14th Sustainable Development Goal by the United Nations: "Life Below Water." 
This project allowed me to dive deep into front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## My Contribution:
My role was student 1 on the provided folders
Splash Screen: An engaging introduction to the site.
Shop & Cart: An interactive shopping experience.
Checkout Page: Seamless transaction interface.
Content Page: Insights into underwater and deep-sea tourism.

This project was an incredible learning opportunity, enhancing my skills in front-end development.
